# IL_ROS_HSR

A package for performing various imitation learning and other tasks with the
Toyota HSR. We'll use this for exploring different projects.

To install, run `python setup.py develop`. Use this in a virtualenv with Python
2.7 (because of ROS compatibility issues).

This code was used for, among other things, the [bed-making project][1], so some
of the scripts and READMEs reflect that code usage. To get the exact code
snapshot that was used for the paper, [clone this other GitHub repository
instead][2] and set it up in your own virtualenv to avoid name clashes. That
repository will not be updated further.
